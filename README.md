## Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based Algorithm Visualizer** developed using **Swing** and **Graphics**.  
It provides interactive visualizations for both **sorting** and **searching** algorithms, helping learners understand algorithmic steps through animations.  

## Why Algorithm Visualization?
Algorithm visualization enhances the learning of computer science by making abstract concepts concrete:  

ðŸ”¹ **Algorithmic Importance**  
- Shows step-by-step execution of sorting and searching  
- Helps in understanding comparison and swapping logic  
- Demonstrates recursive vs iterative processes clearly  

ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Applications**  
- Used in educational tools for teaching algorithms  
- Assists in debugging and analyzing algorithm behavior  
- Foundation for software that supports competitive programming training  

ðŸ”¹ **Educational Value**  
- Simplifies complex algorithms through graphics  
- Encourages experimentation with custom inputs  
- Builds stronger intuition in algorithm design and problem solving

## Key Features
- **Sorting Algorithms**  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Merge Sort  

- **Searching Algorithms**  
  - Linear Search  
  - Binary Search  

- **Additional Operations**  
  - Insertion  
  - Deletion  

- **Interactive Design**  
  - Step-by-step visualization of each algorithm  
  - User can input custom data for experiments  

## Future Extensions
- Add Quick Sort and Heap Sort  
- Implement Graph Algorithms (Kruskalâ€™s, Primâ€™s, A*)  
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)  
- Backtracking Problems (N-Queens, Maze Solver)  
- Export features (Screenshots / Logs)  

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or later  
- Visual Studio with Java Extension Pack  
- Git (for cloning the repository)  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ak1bhasan/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
