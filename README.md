## Course Information
- **Course Title:** Object Oriented Programming Lab  
- **Course Code:** CSE 222  
- **Course Teacher:** Nasif Istiak Remon  
- **Position:** Lecturer, Department of CSE  

## Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based Algorithm Visualizer** developed using **Swing** and **Graphics**.  
It provides interactive visualizations for both **sorting** and **searching** algorithms, helping learners understand algorithmic steps through animations.  

## Why Algorithm Visualization?
Algorithm visualization enhances the learning of computer science by making abstract concepts concrete:  

ðŸ”¹ **Algorithmic Importance**  
- Shows step-by-step execution of sorting and searching  
- Helps in understanding comparison and swapping logic  
- Demonstrates recursive vs iterative processes clearly  

ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Applications**  
- Used in educational tools for teaching algorithms  
- Assists in debugging and analyzing algorithm behavior  
- Foundation for software that supports competitive programming training  

ðŸ”¹ **Educational Value**  
- Simplifies complex algorithms through graphics  
- Encourages experimentation with custom inputs  
- Builds stronger intuition in algorithm design and problem solving
